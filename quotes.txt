George Bernard Shaw

We don't stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.

Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.

Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.

A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing.

Beware of false knowledge; it is more dangerous than ignorance.

The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.

Success does not consist in never making mistakes but in never making the same one a second time.

Mark Twain
----------

The secret of getting ahead is getting started.

If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.

Kindness is the language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.

The best way to cheer yourself up is to try to cheer somebody else up.

Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.
